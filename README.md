# Batch Distillation Project

This repository contains all materials related to the batch distillation project. It is organized to facilitate reproducibility, reference, and further research.

**`Note: work in progress./`**

## Repository Structure

- **`Documentation/`**  
  Contains the project report, paper drafts, appendices, and supplementary documentation.

- **`Codes/`**  
  Python scripts and other code used for simulations, equilibrium curve generation, McCabe-Thiele analysis, and data processing.

- **`Literature_Review/`**  
  Collection of research papers, references, and notes related to batch distillation theory and experimental methods.

- **`Experiments/`**  
  Experimental data, processed datasets, observations, and results from batch distillation runs.

- **`Design/`**  
  CAD models, design sketches, schematics, and calculations related to the distillation apparatus.

## Purpose

This repository provides a comprehensive resource for understanding, reproducing, and extending the batch distillation project, including both theoretical and experimental aspects.

## Usage

1. Refer to `Documentation/` for the full project report and methodology.  
2. Use the scripts in `Codes/` to run simulations and generate analysis plots.  
3. Consult `Literature_Review/` for background reading and references.  
4. Check `Experiments/` for raw and processed experimental results.  
5. Explore `Design/` for apparatus design files and supporting calculations.
